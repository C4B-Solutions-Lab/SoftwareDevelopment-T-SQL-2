#
# Description:
 - safe & fully automated database installation/uninstallation tool for both algorithms
 - no manual work required
 - no opening anything in SSMS any more
 - just 6 clicks and SQL scripts are installed into database
 - tested against LOCAL COMPUTER running SQL Server (2008 - 2014)
 - Limitations regarding WPF installer:
   - if you f.e. install JSON2SQL (Install button), then SQL2JSON you have to reinstall (Reinstall button) and vice versa due to sharing some common functions.
    - this limitation fix is postponed.
